# Fish Tank
### Description
This is a program that simulates a tank full fill Platax Teira. Platax Teira can change moving direction when they hit other objects or each other. They also have the tendency to follow each other.
### Artist Statement
I am trying to simulate a group of Platax Teira actions in a fish tank.
