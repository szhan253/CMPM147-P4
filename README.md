# Fish Tank
### Description
This is a program that simulates a tank full fill Platax Teira. Platax Teira can change moving direction when they hit other objects or each other. They also have the tendency to follow each other. Additionally, there is a catcher generated at the mouse position and trying to catch the Platax Teira in the tank. Thus, the Platax Teira is trying to get away from the catcher. Additionally, fishes also need to be fed. Thus, there is a small red circle is acting like fish food. When the Platax Teira group gets near to the food, it is attracted by the food.
### Artist Statement
I am trying to simulate a group of Platax Teira actions in a fish tank. It is hard to use graphs to draw all the objects in the scene. For example, I am using two circles that which one of the circle’s colors is the same as the background to create the fish’s tail. However, in that case, the background color circle will cause some problems when the fish overlaps the seaweeds. I haven’t had any idea about how to solve this problem, so I just change the circle to eclipse to try to reduce the effects when the seaweed and fishes are overlapping each other.
